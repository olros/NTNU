## 🚀 Getting started

This project requires Maven and Spring boot.

From now on it's enough to run `mvn:run` to run the application.

#### ⚙ Configuration

The application requires configuration of some environment variables in order to run. These should be put in a _.env_
file in the repository root.

```

## ✅ Test the application

The tests can be run by running `mvn:test`.
