Theoretical Questions
1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Include at least 3 definitions of AI that are not covered in the
lecture.

- Artificial intelligence has no clear definition, but there is a lot of different definitions that varies by how one think the system should think and act.
  The quotes below shows some definitions by different people:  

  - Kurzweil, 1990: "The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people"
  - Schalkoff, 1990: "A field of study that seeks to explain and emulate intelligent behavior in terms of computational processes"
  - Winston, 1992: "The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act"

2. What is the Turing test? What is its purpose and how is it conducted?

- A Turing test is a test which may be used to check if a computer has artificial intelligence.
  It is conducted by letting a human ask questions and use the answers and other sensory impressions to determine if the respondant is a person or computer.
  The computer do have artificial intelligence if the questioner isn't able to determine if the respondant is a person or computer.

3. What is rationality?

- Rationality is the ability to execute "the right action", based on the currently known facts and knowledge.
  One may think of it as a measure of the ideal performance that can be acieved.

4. What is the difference between thinking rationally and acting rationally? Is rational thinking an
absolute condition for acting rationally?

- Rational thinking is when logic is used to find the right decision or conclusion.
  Acting rationally, on the other hand, is about making the "right decision" which maximizes the outcome, given the known information.

  Rational thinking can be part of rational action, but it doesn't have to. Rational actions can be done without logic/thinking, for example reflexes.
  The Touring test is an example of a test where rational action is needed and rational thinking not always will be part of the actions. 

5. What is the connection between knowledge and action according to Aristotle? How can his argument be used to implement his idea in AI?
(a) Who was (or were) the first AI researcher(s) to implement these ideas?
(b) What is the name of the program or system they developed? Write a short description about it.

- Aristotle created syllogisms which provided patterns which found the correct action based on the given knowledge. This was a way to define how to "think correctly"
  In AI, this may be used by using logic until a conclusion is found. If there is no logical conclusion, the program will enter an infinite loop.
- (a) The first researchers to implement Artistotle's algoritm was Newell and Simon
- (b) It was called General Problem Solver. The program could solve any problem that was expressed with formulas or Horn clauses,
  and with a directed graph between the sources and the sinks could in theory be solved. Real-world problems was however not that easy to solve since
  the search for a conclusion quickly would lead to a too high problem complexity due to combinatorics. (Wikipedia contributors, 2021)

6. Consider a robot with the task of crossing the road, and an action portfolio A:
A = {lookBack, lookForward, lookLeft, lookRight, goForward, goBack, goLeft, goRight}
• While crossing the road, an elk crashes on the robot and smashes it. Is the robot rational?

- Yes, assuming that the elk could not be seen. A rational robot can't be expected to expect everything.
  Even though the robot had looked around, an elk could still suddenly have emerged from behind a tree and smashed it.

• While crossing the road on a green light, a passing car drives into the robot and crashes,
preventing the robot from crossing to the other side. Is the robot rational?

- Yes. By crossing the road on a green light, the robot a done some rational thinking knowing that when the light is green, it's save to cross.
  Nobody could have expected that a passing car would ignore its red light.

7. Consider the vacuum cleaner world described in Figure 2.2 (Chapter 2.1 of AIMA 4th Ed.). Let
us modify this vacuum environment such that the agent is penalized 1 point for each movement:
• Could a simple reflex agent be rational for this environment? Why?

- No. Since it can know if the current position contains dirt, it can suck the dirt if it exists.
  It will never know whether the other location contains dirt or if the other location recently have been cleaned.
  The robot must therefore always move to the other location to check and potentially clean it, most of the moves will therefore be penalized.

• Could a reflex agent with state be rational in this environment? Why?

- Yes. By knowing where the agent have been before and when, it can through time find out how often a location needs to be vacuumed and
  therefore not move too often and get unnecessary penalties.

• Assume now that the simple reflex agent (i.e. no internal state) can perceive the clean status
of both locations at the same time. Could this agent be rational? Why? In case it could be
rational, write the agent function using mathematical notation.

- Yes. Because it known the clean status of both locations at all times, it can delay movement to the other location until it's dirty.
  That will lead to maximizing the potential score. This can be written like the following with mathematical notation:

  P = {CurrentDirty, RightDirty, LeftDirty}
  A = {Clean, MoveRight, MoveLeft}
  f: P* -> A

8. Consider the original vacuum cleaner environment shown in Figure 2.2. Describe the environment using the properties from Chapter 2.3.2 (e.g. episodic/sequential, deterministic/stochastic,
etc.) Explain why you chose such values and properties.

- The environment is:
  - partially observable -> Only the status of the location where the cleaner is positioned is known.
  - single-agent -> There is only one cleaner
  - deterministic -> The next state of the location is determined by the cleaner
  - sequential -> Decisions of cleaning affects whether the location is clean in the next episode
  - dynamic -> The location's status may be changed, with dirt being added at any time 
  - continuous -> Time passes, unrelated by whether the robot acts or not

9. Write both advantages and limitations of the following types of agents:
• Simple reflex agents

- Advantages:
  - Simple implementation

- Limitations:
  - Limited intelligence
  - Single states can be difficult to understand and act rationally from
  - Easy to end up in an infinite loop (which may be escaped with randomized actions)

• Model-based reflex agents

- Advantages:
  - Handles partial observability since the agent can keep track of the unknown

- Limitations:
  - The state will almost never known partially observable environments exaclty, but a best guess.
    Actions will therefore also be based on the best guess
  - Has no goal but only acts based on events/reflexes 

• Goal-based agents

- Advantages:
  - Since the agent has a goal, it can make decisions based on what it thinks may be most profitable in the future

- Limitations:
  - Less effective and more complex since it has to predict/think about future goal achievement

• Utility-based agents

- Advantages:
  - More flexible than goal-based agents and they can learn from previous actions.

- Limitations:
  - Difficult to create models which maximizes utility
